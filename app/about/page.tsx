      Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while
      I am in a transitional period so I dont wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I cant give you this case,
      it dont belong to me. Besides, I have already been through too much shit this morning over this case to
      hand it over to your dumb ass.

      The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of
      evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley
      of darkness, for he is truly his brothers keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down
      upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My
      brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
